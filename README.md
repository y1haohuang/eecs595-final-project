## eecs595-final-project (Group 50)



### Requirements

+ Python 3
+ NumPy
+ SciPy
+ Gensim

The data could be obtained here:

 https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/resources/corpora/sem-eval-ulscd/

and should be copied into `main/data/test-data/*`

The initial embeddings should be downloaded here:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LQ1_Lp-rDAlFy9PpNM4tTnEKFFoY_Ztb

and should be unzipped into `main/data/embedding_export/*`

### Usage

The initial pipeline could be run by `main/main.py`,  using SGNS embeddings, performing Canonical Correlation Analysis and using cosine similarity. Binary threshold and nearest neighbor could be switched by changing values in `main/compare.py`.

##### Multi-sense Embeddings

To use multi-sense embeddings, you first need a compiler with C++11 support such as g++-4.7.2 or newer or clang-3.3 or newer. The code can be compiled by `make`, which will generate `multics`, an executable.

To generate multi-sense embeddings data should be put into `data/`, and run `bash exps/example.sh` with correct input and output directories. The generated embeddings should then be moved to `main/data/embedding_export/*` to be used by the main pipeline.

##### Orthogonal Procrustes

The mapped embeddings could be generated by running the following commands in `vecmap/`:

`python3 map_embeddings.py --normalize unit --init_identical --orthogonal <SRC.EMB> <TRG.EMB> <SRC_MAPPED.EMB> <TRG_MAPPED.EMB>`

These embeddings should then be copied to correct path and set `use_op  = True` in `main/compare.py`.
